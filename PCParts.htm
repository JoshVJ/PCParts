<h2>Quick Summary:</h2>

<pre>
Computers all rely on these 6 basic parts:
The <b>Motherboard</b>
The <b>Central Processing Unit</b> (CPU)
The <b>Random Access Memory</b> (RAM)
The <b>Graphics Processing Unit</b> (GPU)
The <b>Hard Disk Drive/Solid State Drive</b> (HDD/SSD)
And the <b>Power Supply Unit</b> (PSU)

As you scroll down, there will be sections for each part to learn about.

<h2>The Motherboard:</h2>
<p1><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/3347/3600893754_e2ef82ff0f_b.jpg" alt="Gaming Computer" width="600" height="400"></p1>
<p>
The motherboard is a board that controls all of the major components of a computer, where you can find the CPU, GPU, RAM, and HDD. There are different motherboards, some specific for gaming, and some specific to business, yet all motherboards can hold components. These components, of course, are of different specs, as there are some components made for gaming and high-end computers, and some components made for office computers, or lower-end computers. Higher-end computers will need more expensive parts that can perform better and can handle more workload as opposed to lower-end computers.

<h2> The CPU </h2>
<p1><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1589749807521-dd6bc0d4f75d?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=870&q=80" width="600" height="400"></p1>
<p>
The CPU (<i>also known as the Central Processing Unit</i>) is commonly described as the "brains of the computer" as it controls everything that happens in the computer when run. It processes data in the computer's processes, and runs programs (which are instructions to the computer). Without a CPU, none of the other parts in a computer would work, as they all rely on the CPU to know what to do. CPUs work with the pins found at the bottom of the CPU, which interact with the motherboard to receive power and processes. The CPU goes in the socket in the motherboard in order to work with the rest of the components.

<h2> The RAM </h2>
<p1><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1592664474505-51c549ad15c5?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=870&q=80" width="600" height="400"></p1>
<p>
The RAM (<i>also known as Random Access Memory</i>) stores short-term memory to be used by the CPU and the rest of the computer. The data stored is temporary, and resets when a computer reboots. RAM also can help out a CPU, as with faster RAM, the CPU can process faster. The difference between RAM, and HDDs/SSDs (which you will see soon) is that the storage is transferred instantly and is used directly by the CPU, it is not stored after a computer shuts down, as opposed to HDDs/SSDs which store the computer's storage permanently. RAM comes in the form of a stick which plugs into the motherboard, some RAM sticks are much flashier than other RAM (some having RGB lights), yet all RAM sticks have the same function, just with different power.

<h2> The GPU </h2>
<p1><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1624701928517-44c8ac49d93c?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1170&q=80" width="600" height="400"></p1>
<p>
The GPU (<i>also known as the Graphics Processing Unit</i>) processes graphics for the computer, and outputs them through HDMI, DisplayPort, or more rarely nowadays, VGA, allowing the user to use the computer and see what is happening. The GPU is really important when recording or in gaming, as it is the component which processes all of the graphics in the game, making the games run smoothly and look great. All computers need graphics cards, although some have integrated GPUs, which have the GPU integrated inside the CPU, good for those who don't need to record/game at high qualities. For more information on integrated GPUs (vs. Dedicated GPUs), check out <a href="https://techguided.com/dedicated-graphics-card-vs-integrated-graphics/">this website. </a>

<h2> The HDD/SSD </h2>
<p1><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1589995186011-a7b485edc4bf?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8Mnx8aGRkfGVufDB8fDB8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=500&q=60" width="600" height="400"></p1>
<p>
The HDD (<i>also known as a Hard Disk Drive</i>) stores permanent data onto a disk for the computer to use. The operating system (such as Windows or Linux) also boots with the help of a hard drive, or an SSD (Solid State Drive) which is much faster than a HDD, as it does not use a disk to store data and instead stores it with flash memory, similar to that of a USB stick. HDDs are cheaper and slower than SSDs, but typically store much more storage while SSDs are more expensive, but for fast memory. You can have multiple HDDs and SSDs in a PC, as long as you have space for it.

<h2> The PSU </h2>
<p1><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1675893857450-783969c8922f?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8Mnx8cHN1fGVufDB8fDB8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=500&q=60" width="600" height="400"></p1>
<p>
The PSU (<i>also called the Power Supply Unit</i>) provides all power to the PC components, mainly the motherboard and hard drives, although in higher-end PCs with higher quality GPUs, some GPUs may take power directly from the power supply as well. There are pin connectors, which connect from the power supply to the component in order to provide power to the component, just like plugging in a charger to a wall, although with higher quality plugs. The PSU plugs into a regular outlet.
