PC Parts in a nutshell sample webpage.
This project was for my Computer Science 1 class, where we had to build a webpage (not to be published as a website). 
It briefly explains the necessary components of a PC, while offering some other resources to learn more to help people who know nothing about computer hardware learn more about the parts of a computer.
This page can be useful as not many people are aware of what all of the components in a computer do, and I'd like to help out and give some resources to help out.
